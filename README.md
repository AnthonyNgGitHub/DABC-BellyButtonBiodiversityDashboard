# DABC-BellyButtonBiodiversityDashboard

## The purpose of the repository is to create a dashboard to visualize the key bacterial data from the given sample data of Belly Button bacteria. Depending on the selected test subject ID, the dashboard will automatically update and present the cooresponding demographic information of the volunteer, the top 10 bacterial cultures found, the frequency of belly button washing, and the bacteria cultures per sample related to the volunteer. 

## This exercise is performed by utilizing Javascript to read in data stored in a json file, and create graphs with Plotly to be shown on an html file, which is published on GitPages.
